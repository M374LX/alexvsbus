This directory contains the old versions of the music tracks forming the game's
OST, as well as the demo versions made before we decided to go with an 8-bit
style.

In addition to the tracks rendered as .ogg files, this directory contains the
project files created using LMMS (https://lmms.io) for the music tracks and the
sound effects. 

For the final game, we decided to use the XM format in order to reduce the
total size of the game.
