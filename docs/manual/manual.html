<h2>About the Game</h2>

<p><b>Alex vs Bus: The Race</b> is a free and open source platform runner game
in which Alex is just a man who depends on public transportation in a
developing country and needs to run in order to catch the bus, or else he will
have to wait an eternity for the next bus to come.</p>

<p>Key features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A finished game, no longer WIP, complete with 13 levels across 3
      different difficulties and an ending sequence.</li>
  <li>Audio and visual style inspired by the 8-bit era, although the game is
      not bound to all of the technical limitations of the period.</li>
  <li>Keyboard, gamepad, and touchscreen (Android only) supported as input
      devices.</li>
  <li>A different cutscene when clearing each level.</li>
  <li>Customizable screen size.</li>
  <li>Scanlines visual effect.</li>
  <li>Cross-platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Menu</h2>

<p class="img-center"><img src="img/main-menu.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The main menu is displayed when the game is launched and contains the
following items:</p>

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col class="width35">
    <col class="width65">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="img/icon-play.png" alt="Icon"> Play</th>
    <td>To start the game after selecting a difficulty and then a level.</td>

<h2>Starting the game</h2>

<p>To start playing the game from the main menu:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select "Play".<br>
    <img src="img/main-menu-small.png" alt="Image">
</li>
<li>Select a difficulty (normal, hard, or super). Only normal is available
    initially, but clearing all levels of a difficulty unlocks the next
    one.<br>
    <img src="img/difficulty-select.png" alt="Image">
</li>
<li>Select the level to play. Only the first level is available initially, but
    clearing a level unlocks the next one.<br>
    <img src="img/level-select.png" alt="Image">
</li>
</ol>



<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p class="img-center"><img src="img/screenshot2.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The game can be described as a "platform runner" (not an endless runner). In
each level, the player has 90 seconds to catch the bus while jumping over
holes, banana peels, crates, and other obstacles.</p>

<p>For extra score, you can optionally collect the coins found in the levels.
Collecting a silver coin adds 50 to your score, while collecting a gold coin
adds 100 to it.</p>

<p>When reaching the bus, 10 is added to your score for each remaining second
before the next level starts. If you run out of time before reaching the bus,
however, it will depart without Alex in it and you will be offered the option
to try again. By selecting the check mark
(<img src="img/check.png" alt="Image">), the current level is restarted, but
your score is cleared to zero.</p>

<p>Some of the crates on the way can be pushed to reveal a secret passageway.
If pushing a crate is required in order to progress, an arrow with the word
"push" is shown, but most of the passageways are optional and no arrow is shown.
Finding all of them is up to you.</p>



<h2>Settings</h2>

<p class="img-center"><img src="img/settings.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>You can access the game's settings from either the main or the pause menu.</p>

<p>The settings menu contains the following items:</p>

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col class="width35">
    <col class="width65">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Display settings</th>
    <td>To open the display settings menu.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Audio settings</th>
    <td>To open the audio settings menu.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Touchscreen buttons on/off<br>
        <span class="no-bold">(only if touchscreen functionality is
        enabled)</span></th>
    <td>To show or hide the touchscreen buttons during the game. You might want
        to hide the buttons if using a physical gamepad on a phone, for
        example.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h3>Display Settings</h3>

<p class="img-center"><img src="img/display-settings.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The display settings menu contains the following items:</p>

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col class="width35">
    <col class="width65">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Fullscreen on/off<br><span class="no-bold">(desktop only)</span></th>
    <td>To select between running the game in fullscreen or windowed mode.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Window scale<br><span class="no-bold">(desktop only)</span></th>
    <td>To select the size of the window when running the game in windowed
        mode, which can be one, two, or three times the size of the game's
        virtual screen (vscreen).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Vscreen size</th>
    <td>To customize the size of the game's virtual screen (vscreen). More
        details can be found in the section "Virtual Screen (Vscreen)" of this
        manual.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Scanlines on/off</th>
    <td>To enable or disable a scanlines visual effect, which simulates the
        visible scanlines of an old CRT television set. The scanlines will
        appear only if the physical screen or window is at least twice the size
        of the game's virtual screen (vscreen).</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h3>Virtual Screen (Vscreen)</h3>

<p class="img-center"><img src="img/vscreen-size.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>In order to look more like a game from the 8-bit (or even 16-bit) era, the
game uses a virtual screen (also referred to as "vscreen") ranging from 256 to
480 pixels in width and from 192 to 270 pixels in height, which is scaled to
fill larger physical screens.</p>

<p>The size of the vscreen can be customized by selecting "Vscreen size" on the
settings menu.</p>

<p>The vscreen sizing mode can be set to "auto" or "manual". When set to "auto",
the size that best fits in the physical screen is determined automatically. If
set to "manual", however, the size can be set manually.</p>

<p>A vscreen size of 480x270 will be scaled perfectly on a modern 1920x1080
monitor, while a smaller vscreen size can be used to simulate an old console's
screen size (and make the game more challenging), like 256x192 for the Sega
Master System or 320x224 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Similarly, a vscreen
size of 320x256 will be scaled perfectly on a 1280x1024 monitor.</p>

<h3>Audio Settings</h3>

<p class="img-center"><img src="img/audio-settings.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The audio settings menu contains the following items:</p>

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col class="width35">
    <col class="width65">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Audio on/off</th>
    <td>If set to "off", the audio is disabled entirely. This is the same as
        disabling the audio from the main or pause menu.</td>

    <td>To enable or disable music.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

<h2>Pause Menu</h2>

<p class="img-center"><img src="img/pause-menu.png" alt="Image"></p>

 tapping the pause button (<img src="img/pause-button.png" alt="Image">), found
at the top-right corner of the screen.</p>

<p>When pausing the game, a menu with the following items appears:</p>

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col class="width35">
    <col class="width65">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="img/icon-play.png" alt="Icon"> Resume</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="img/icon-try-again.png" alt="Icon"> Try again</th>

<h2>Config File Location</h2>

<p>The table below gives the default location of the config file, in which the
game progress and settings are saved, for each platform:</p>

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col class="width25">
    <col class="width75">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Android</th>
    <td>Internal storage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Windows</th>
    <td>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\alexvsbus\alexvsbus.cfg</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Linux and others</th>
    <td>/home/&lt;username&gt;/.config/alexvsbus/alexvsbus.cfg</td>

<p>On Linux and other operating systems, the XDG Base Directory Specification
is implemented, which means that the directory prefix can be changed by setting
the <span class="monospace">XDG_CONFIG_HOME</span> environment variable.</p>

<p>On desktop platforms, a non-default location for the config file can be set
by using the <span class="monospace">--config</span> command-line option.</p>
